The purpose of this exercise is to examine arithmetic circuits that add, subtract,
and multiply numbers. Each circuit will be described in VHDL and implemented on an 
Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} FPGA DE10-Lite, DE0-CV, DE1-SoC, or DE2-115 board.

\section*{Part I}
\addcontentsline{toc}{1}{Part I}
Consider again the four-bit ripple-carry adder circuit used in lab exercise 2; its diagram is reproduced in Figure~\ref{fig:ripple_carry}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centerline{
\includegraphics{figures/ripple_carry}}
\caption{A four-bit ripple carry adder.}
\label{fig:ripple_carry}
\end{figure}

This circuit can be implemented using a '+' sign in VHDL. For example, the following code fragment adds {\it n}-bit numbers $A$ and $B$ to produce outputs $sum$ and $carry$:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[t]{12.5 cm}
\begin{tabbing}
ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\=ZZ\kill
\>LIBRARY ieee;\\
\>USE ieee.std\_logic\_1164.all;\\
\>USE ieee.std\_logic\_arith.all;\\
\>USE ieee.std\_logic\_signed.all;\\
\>\ldots \\
\>SIGNAL sum : STD\_LOGIC\_VECTOR(n-1 DOWNTO 0);\\
\>\ldots \\
\>sum $<$= A + B;\\
\end{tabbing}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

Use this construct to implement a circuit shown in Figure~\ref{fig:accumulator}. This
circuit, which is often called an {\it accumulator}, is used to add the value of an input
$A$ to itself repeatedly. The circuit includes a carry out from the adder, as well as an
{\it overflow} output signal. If the input $A$ is considered as a 2's-complement number, 
then {\it overflow} should be set to~1
in the case where the output {\it sum} produced does not represent a correct
2's-complement result.

~\\
Perform the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new Quartus\textsuperscript{\textregistered} project. Write VHDL code that describes the 
circuit in Figure~\ref{fig:accumulator}.
\item Connect input $A$ to switches {\it SW}$_{7-0}$, use {\it KEY}$_0$ as an 
active-low asynchronous reset, and use {\it KEY}$_1$ as a manual clock input. The sum 
from the adder should be displayed on the red lights {\it LEDR}$_{7-0}$, the registered 
carry signal should be displayed on {\it LEDR}$_{8}$, and the registered {\it overflow} 
signal should be displayed on {\it LEDR}$_{9}$. Show the registered values of {\it A}
and {\it S} as hexadecimal numbers on the 7-segment displays HEX$3-2$ and HEX$1-0$. 
\item Make the necessary pin assignments needed to implement the circuit on your
DE-series board, and compile the circuit.
\item Use timing simulation to verify the correct operation of the
circuit. Once the simulation works properly, generate a .sof file in Quartus, upload it to the NO-IDE lab of LabsLand, 
and test it by using different values of~$A$. Be sure to check that the {\it overflow} 
output works correctly.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Part II}
\addcontentsline{toc}{2}{Part II}
Extend the circuit from Part I to be able to both add and subtract numbers. To do so,
introduce an {\it add\_sub} input to your circuit. When {\it add\_sub} is 1, your circuit should
subtract $A$ from $S$, and when {\it add\_sub} is 0 your circuit should add 
$A$ to $S$ as in Part I.

\section*{Part III}
\addcontentsline{toc}{3}{Part III}
Figure~\ref{fig:binary_multiplication}$a$ gives an example of paper-and-pencil multiplication $P = A \times B$, where $A = 11$ and $B = 12$.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics{figures/figure3.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Multiplication of binary numbers.}
	\label{fig:binary_multiplication}
\end{figure}

We compute $P = A \times B$ as an addition of summands. The first summand is equal to $A$ times the ones digit of $B$.
The second summand is $A$ times the tens digit of $B$, shifted one position to the left. We add the two summands to form the product $P = 132$.

~\\
Part $b$ of the figure shows the same example using four-bit binary numbers.
To compute $P = A \times B$, we first form summands by multiplying $A$ by each digit of $B$. Since each digit of
$B$ is either 1 or 0, the summands are either shifted versions of $A$ or 0000. Figure ~\ref{fig:binary_multiplication}$c$
shows how each summand can be formed by using the Boolean AND operation of $A$ with the appropriate bit of $B$.

~\\
A four-bit circuit that implements $P = A \times B$ is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:array_mult}. Because of its
regular structure, this type of multiplier circuit is called an {\it array multiplier}. The shaded areas correspond to the shaded columns in Figure~\ref{fig:binary_multiplication}$c$. In each row of the multiplier AND gates are used to produce the summands,
and full adder modules are used to generate the required sums.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[]{figures/figure4.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\caption{An array multiplier circuit.}
	\label{fig:array_mult}
\end{figure}

Perform the following steps to implement the array multiplier circuit:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new Quartus project.
\item Generate the required VHDL file. Use switches {\it SW}$_{7-4}$ to represent the 
number $A$ and switches {\it SW}$_{3-0}$ to represent $B$. The hexadecimal values of~$A$ 
and $B$ are to be displayed on the 7-segment displays {\it HEX}2 and {\it HEX}0, respectively.
The result ~$P = A \times B$~ is to be displayed on {\it HEX}$5-4$.
\item Make the necessary pin assignments needed to implement the circuit on your
DE-series board, and compile the circuit.
\item Use simulation to verify your design.
\item Generate a .sof file in Quartus, upload it to the NO-IDE lab of LabsLand and test its functionality.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Part IV}
\addcontentsline{toc}{4}{Part IV}
In Part III, an array multiplier was implemented using full adder modules. At a higher level, a row of full adders functions as an $n$-bit adder and the array multiplier circuit can be represented as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:array_mult_adders}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centerline{
\includegraphics{figures/array_mult_adders}}
\caption{An array multiplier implemented using $n$-bit adders.}
\label{fig:array_mult_adders}
\end{figure}

Each $n$-bit adder adds a shifted version of $A$ for a given row and the {\it partial
product} of the row above. Abstracting the multiplier circuit as a sequence of additions 
allows us to build larger multipliers. The multiplier should consist of n-bit adders
arranged in a structure shown in Figure~\ref{fig:array_mult_adders}. Use this approach to 
implement an 8 {\sf x} 8 multiplier circuit with registered
inputs and outputs, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:registered_mult}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centerline{
\includegraphics{figures/registered_mult}}
\caption{A registered multiplier circuit.}
\label{fig:registered_mult}
\end{figure}

Perform the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a new Quartus project and write the required VHDL file.
\item Use switches {\it SW}$_{7-0}$ to provide the data inputs to the circuit. Use
{\it SW}$_9$ as the enable signal {\it EA} for register {\it A}, and use {\it SW}$_8$
as the enable for register {\it B}.  When {\it SW}$_9 = 1$ display the contents of
register A on the red lights LEDR, and display the contents of register B on these lights
when {\it SW}$_8 = 1$. Use {\it KEY}$_0$ as a synchronous reset input, and use 
{\it KEY}$_1$ as a manual clock signal.  Show the product~$P = A \times B$~ as a
hexadecimal number on the 7-segment displays {\it HEX3-0}.
\item Make the necessary pin assignments needed to implement the circuit on your
DE-series board, and compile the circuit.
\item Generate a .sof file in Quartus, upload it to the NO-IDE lab of LabsLand and test the functionality of your design by inputting various data values and observing
the generated products.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Part V}
\addcontentsline{toc}{5}{Part V}
Part IV showed how to implement multiplication $A \times B$ as a sequence of additions, 
by accumulating the shifted versions of $A$ one row at a time. Another way to implement 
this circuit is to perform addition using an adder tree.

An adder tree is a method of adding several numbers together in a parallel fashion. This 
idea is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:adder_tree}. In the figure, numbers 
$A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, $G$, and $H$ are added together in parallel.
The addition $A + B$ happens simultaneously with $C + D$, $E + F$ and $G + H$. The 
result of these operations are then added in parallel
again, until the final sum $P$ is computed.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centerline{
\includegraphics{figures/adder_tree}}
\caption{An example of adding 8 numbers using an adder tree.}
\label{fig:adder_tree}
\end{figure}

In this part you are to implement an 8 {\sf x} 8 multiplier circuit by using the adder-tree
approach. Inputs $A$ and $B$, as well as the output $P$ should be registered as in Part IV.
